If you’ve stumbled across this blog, you’re probably here for one of two reasons:

1. You’re interested in the world of Detection Engineering; the art and science of building, tuning, and automating the rules that help us detect threats before they cause damage.

2. You enjoy the occasional detour into musings about technology, creativity, philosophy, and the curious ways they intersect with life.

Either way, you’re in the right place.

This site is my public notebook; a place to document experiments, lessons learned, and the occasional side quest. I'm in the process of building a Detection Engineering lab, I plan to work with tools like OpenCTI, MISP, Elastic Stack, GitLab, Sigma, Velociraptor, Atomic Red Team, and more. It’s a space where I can test theories, break things on purpose, and build them back up better. Think of it as a sandbox for ideas; some will work, some won’t, and all will teach something useful.

You’ll see posts on things like:

- How to turn threat intel into actionable detections
- Automating rule deployment with CI/CD pipelines
- Lessons learned from fighting false positives (and their sneaky sibling, the false negative)
-Integrating open source tools into a cohesive detection workflow
- Building repeatable processes that can survive real-world chaos

But because life isn’t just packet captures, detection rules, and log aggregation, I’ll also share the occasional tangent. That could mean thoughts on problem-solving, bits of creative writing, reflections on learning, an occasional deep dive in philosophy, or simply something fascinating I ran across that deserves more than a passing glance. Consider this the “off-limits” folder in the lab, except here, it’s wide open.

If you’re here for my writings, learnings, problem-solving, and ideas; you’ll find it in my Blog. My curated lists, resources, and cheat sheets live in Resources.

I believe in making the process as visible as the results. The internet is full of perfect write-ups and polished success stories, but this space embraces the messy middle; the troubleshooting steps, the “why didn’t that work?” moments, and the unexpected turns that lead somewhere better.

So pull up a terminal, grab a cup of coffee (or something stronger), and let’s explore this space where code meets curiosity, and detection meets creativity. Welcome to the my lab.
