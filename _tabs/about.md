This blog is a notebook disguised as a website. It’s where ideas go to stretch their legs, where logs are more than just lines of text, and where systems (both digital and human) are picked apart and put back together (sometimes in better shape, sometimes just louder).

I write here about the art and grit of detection engineering, threat hunting, and the occasional homelab misadventure. If you like your tech with a side of curiosity and dry humor, you’ll probably feel at home.

From time to time, I may take detours into other rabbit holes; books, philosophy, strange patterns, or whatever else manages to hijack my attention. It keeps things interesting.

No growth hacks. No personal brands. Just experiments, reflections, and the occasional success worth documenting.

Thanks for stopping by. Poke around. Break things gently.
