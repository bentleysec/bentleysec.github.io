# 🛠️ Detection Engineering Lab & Musings

Welcome to the GitHub repo for my blog, bentleysec.com, a space where **Detection Engineering**, security lab experiments, and the occasional curiosity-driven tangent all live under one roof.

This blog documents my journey building and experimenting with a full Detection Engineering lab environment. It’s part technical reference, part personal log, and part creative outlet.

## What You’ll Find Here

### Detection Engineering
- Designing and tuning detection rules  
- Automating deployments with CI/CD pipelines  
- Integrating threat intelligence into actionable detections  
- Fighting false positives (and false negatives)  
- Building processes that can survive real-world chaos  

### Lab Experiments
I work hands-on with tools like:
- **OpenCTI**
- **MISP**
- **Elastic Stack**
- **GitLab**
- **Sigma**
- **Velociraptor**
- **Atomic Red Team**

These are tested, broken, reconfigured, and documented so you can follow along — or avoid my mistakes.

### Musings & Side Quests
Not everything here is pure security engineering. Expect:
- Thoughts on learning, creativity, and problem-solving  
- Small side projects and experiments
- Random tech curiosities worth sharing
- Philosophical tangents

## 📂 Blog Structure

The blog has three main sections:

- **Blog** – Regular posts about Detection Engineering, security tooling, and tech musings.  
- **Resources** – Curated lists, cheat sheets, and helpful references.  

## 🎯 Goals

1. Share practical, real-world Detection Engineering knowledge.  
2. Document the messy middle of building and testing — not just the polished results.  
3. Create a resource for others exploring Detection-as-Code, threat hunting, and purple teaming.
